# TrafficLightVis
Traffic light bar visualizer in HTML 5 Canvas, programmed in vanilla JavaScript.

Reads in a configuration JSON for signal groups as well as detectors, with their names. When running it periodically reads in a state JSON which contains start and end times for bars, as well as some metadata. These bars are then displayed dynamically on lines. When mouse is hovered over a bar, metadata for that bar is displayed.
